# Books Library

## Objective

The Books Library is a web application that dynamically fetches and displays book data from the FreeAPI.app. This project helps in practicing API requests, handling JSON data, and rendering dynamic content using JavaScript.

## Features

- Fetch books from the API and display them in a **list** or **grid** view.
- Allow users to switch between list and grid layouts.
- Display book details including **title, author, publisher, published date,** and **thumbnail**.
- Implement a search bar to filter books by **title** or **author**.
- Provide a sorting feature to arrange books in:
  - **Alphabetical order (A-Z) based on title**
  - **Published date (newest to oldest)**
- Implement pagination to fetch and display additional books as the user scrolls.
- Clicking on a book item opens detailed information in a **new tab** using `infoLink`.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **Fetch API** for retrieving book data dynamically
